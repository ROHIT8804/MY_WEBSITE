The concept of healthy living has evolved from a laser focus on fitness and nutrition into a mentality about holistic health.

From mental health, to family and work life, living a healthy life is multifaceted. And the key is often balancing it all. Finding that balance can be tricky… and the overwhelming amount of advice on the web doesn’t necessarily make it any easier.

In compiling our list of the best healthy living blogs, we looked for the bloggers who are leading by example. Healthy living isn’t always easy. But knowing that you have role models and supportive communities to lift you up when you’re ready to throw in the towel can make all the difference.</p>
